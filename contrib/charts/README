=========================

This directory contains XSL stylesheets to create charts from XML data. 
This has been contributed by John Morrison (john.r.morrison@ntlworld.com).

The <xsl> directory contains stylesheets for different kinds of charts,
such as bar charts and pie charts. The <xml> directory contains an example
of XML document that can be processed by the XSL stylesheets. The DTD has
not been contributed yet but will be added shortly.
