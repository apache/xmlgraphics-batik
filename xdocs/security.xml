    <s1 title="Introduction">
        <p>
        With the addition of scripting support in Batik 1.5, security features
        have also been added to enable users of the Batik toolkit to run 
        scripts in a secure manner.</p>
        <p>
        If you are using scripts, please make sure you have reviewed the 
        <link href="index.html#SecurityWarning">Script Security 
        Warning</link> with regards to the Batik 1.5 release.
        </p>
        <p>
       There are two major script security features in Batik:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><link href="#sandBox">Script execution</link></li>
            <li><link href="#externalResources">Access to linked resources</link></li>
        </ul>
    </s1>

    <anchor id="sandBox" />
    <s1 title="Running scripts securely">

        <p>The Java platform offers a lot of options for running applications securely.
        Running an application securely requires that it runs in a so-called 
        security sand-box which controls all the access the application makes to 
        restricted resources (such as the file system).
        </p>

        <p>The concept of Java security is an application-wide concept. As such, it
        has to be applied at the application level (and not at the framework level).
        In the Batik distribution, the sample applications (such as the 
        <link href="svgviewer.html">Squiggle Browser</link> or the <link href="svgrasterizer.html">SVG 
        rasterizer</link>) apply security (or disable it) but the framework does not
        apply it: it is security-aware (meaning that it is able to handle security
        exceptions).</p>

        <s2 title="Enforcing security in a Batik application">

            <p>
            Enforcing security in a Batik application is done by setting a 
            <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code>. This security manager
            will apply the security settings of the Java platform (as defined
            by the <code>[jre-dir]/lib/security/java.policy</code> and, optionally,
            by the policy file whose url is defined in the <code>java.security.policy</code>
            system property).
            </p>

            <p>
            The <code>org.apache.batik.util.ApplicationSecurityEnforcer</code>
            helper class makes it easier for Batik application 
            developers to add security support in their applications. That
            helper class is used by the sample Batik applications.
            </p>
        </s2>

        <s2 title="Squiggle security">

            <p>
            The Squiggle browser lets the user decide whether or not scripts
            should be run securely (see the "Browser Options" in the 
            preference dialog box). When scripts are run securely, Squiggle
            will enforce the security settings as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The default policy is defined by the policy file found
                in the distribution: <code>org/apache/batik/apps/svgbrowser/svgbrowser.policy</code>.
                In the binary distribution, that file would be in the
                <code>batik-squiggle.jar</code> file. In the source
                distribution, that file would be in the
                <code>resources</code> directory.  The default policy
                file gives appropriate permissions to the Batik code,
                the XML parser and the Rhino scripting engine and very
                limited permissions to scripts. </li> <li>At startup
                time, and whenever the preference settings are
                modified, Squiggle makes a copy of the default policy
                and appends any additional permissions granted to
                scripts by the user through the preference
                settings. This policy file can be found in the
                <code>[user.home]/.batik</code> directory. It is
                called <code>__svgbrowser.policy</code>.  Note that
                this file is automatically generated and should not be
                modified manually (as any edits would be lost).</li>
                <li>The policy defined as described above is enforced
                unless the <code>java.security.policy</code> system
                property is defined. In that case, the policy defined
                by the system property takes precedence and the policy
                file generated from the Squiggle preferences is
                ignored.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important Note</strong></p>
                <p>
                The default policy files assume that the applications use the 
                Xerces parser and give appropriate permissions to its 
                <code>lib/xerces-2_5_0.jar</code> JAR file. If you are using 
                a different XML parser, you need to modify the policy files to 
                grant the propser permissions to your XML parser instead of 
                Xerces. You will have to replace:
                </p>
<source>
grant codeBase "${app.dev.base}/lib/xerces_2_5_0.jar" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</source>
                <p>with:</p>
<source>
grant codeBase "${app.dev.base}/lib/myXMLParser.jar" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</source>
                <p>
                in the <code>resources/org/apache/batik/apps/svgbrowser/resources/svgbrowser.policy</code>
                file (for the source distribution) and do the same in 
                <code>resources/org/apache/batik/apps/svgbrowser/resources/svgbrowser.bin.policy</code> (for 
                the binary distribution which will then need to be rebuilt with the <code>build dist-zip</code>
                command.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Alternatively, you can write your own policy file and specify its
                url through the <code>java.security.policy</code> system property (which you can
                specify through the <code>-Djava.security.policy=&lt;url&gt;</code> command line 
                option).
                </p>

        </s2>

    <anchor id="externalResources" />
    <s1 title="Controlling access to external resources">

        <p>
        SVG makes a very powerful use of external resources in many elements
        such as <code>&lt;image&gt;, &lt;use&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, &lt;script&gt;</code> or
        <code>&lt;radialGradients&gt;</code>. There are over fifteen SVG elements which 
        may reference external resources that way.   
        </p>

        <p>
        In some environments, and typically for security reasons, it is 
        important to control the resources referenced by an SVG document
        and be able to accept or reject these resources.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the Batik toolkit, this flexibility is provided by the 
        <code>org.apache.batik.bridge.UserAgent</code> interface which
        can define various strategies with regards to external resources.
        By providing a new implementation of the <code>UserAgent</code> 
        interface, it is possible to apply the desired security strategy
        for scripts and external resources.</p>

        <p>
        The following <code>UserAgent</code> methods a provided for 
        that purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>getScriptSecurity(scriptType, scriptURL, docURL)</code>
                should return the <code>ScriptSecurity</code> strategy for
                a script of type <code>scriptType</code> (e.g., <code>text/ecmascript</code>)
                coming from <code>scriptURL</code>. 
                when referenced from the document whose url is <code>docURL</code>.</li>
            <li><code>getExternalResourceSecurity(resourceURL, docURL)</code>
                should return the <code>ExternalResourceSecurity</code> for 
                a resource coming from <code>resourceURL</code> referenced
                from the document at url <code>docURL</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The <code>ScriptSecurity</code> and <code>ExternalResourceSecurity</code>
        interfaces have methods (<code>checkLoadScript</code> and 
        <code>checkLoadExternalResource</code> respectively) which should 
        throw a <code>SecurityException</code> if the script or resource 
        is considered a security threat.
        </p>
        <note>the <code>UserAgent</code> interface has two additional methods
        (<code>checkLoadScript</code> and <code>checkLoadExternalResource</code>
        which are meant to provide a short hand for getting a security strategy 
        object and calling the <code>checkLoadXXX</code> method on that object.
        This is how the <code>org.apache.batik.bridge.UserAgentAdapter</code>
        implements this method.
        </note>

        <p>
        Batik provides the following set of <code>ScriptSecurity</code> implementations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>NoLoadScriptSecurity</code>. The scrip resource should not be 
            loaded </li>
            <li><code>EmbededScriptSecurity</code>. The script resource will only 
            be loaded if it is embeded in the SVG document referencing it. This means
            that script attributes (such as <code>onclick</code> on a <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code>
            element is allowed), inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements and 
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements using a <code>data:</code> url 
            (i.e., the script content is Base 64 encoded into the <code>script</code>'s
            <code>xlink:href</code>'s value) will be allowed. All other script
            resources should not be loaded.</li>
            <li><code>DefaultScriptSecurity</code>. The script resource will only 
            be loaded if it is embeded in the SVG document (see the description
            of <code>EmbededScriptSecurity</code>) or if it is coming from the same
            location as the document referencing the script. If the document comes 
            from a network server, then any script coming from that server will
            be allowed. If the document comes from the file system, then only 
            scripts under the same directory root as the SVG document will be allowed.</li>
            <li><code>RelaxedScriptSecurity</code>. Scripts from any location can 
            be loaded.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        In addition, Batik provides the following set of <code>ExternalResourceSecurity</code>
        implementations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>NoLoadExternalResourceSecurity</code>. No external references are allowed</li>
            <li><code>EmbededExternalResourceSecurity</code>. Only resources embeded into the 
            file are allowed (i.e., references through the <code>data:</code> protocol</li>
            <li><code>DefaultExternalResourceSecurity</code>. Embeded external resources (see above)
            and resources coming from the same location as the document referencing them
            are allowed.</li>
            <li><code>RelaxedExternalResourceSecurity</code>. Resources from any location
            can be loaded.</li>
        </ul>
            
    </s1>
