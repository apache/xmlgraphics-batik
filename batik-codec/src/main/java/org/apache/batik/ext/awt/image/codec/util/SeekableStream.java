/**
 * An abstract subclass of <code>java.io.InputStream</code> that allows seeking
 * within the input, similar to the <code>RandomAccessFile</code> class.
 * Additionally, the <code>DataInput</code> interface is supported and extended
 * to include support for little-endian representations of fundamental data
 * types.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the familiar methods from <code>InputStream</code>, the
 * methods <code>getFilePointer()</code>, <code>seek()</code>, are defined as in
 * the <code>RandomAccessFile</code> class.  The <code>canSeekBackwards()</code>
 * method will return <code>true</code> if it is permissible to seek to a
 * position earlier in the stream than the current value of
 * <code>getFilePointer()</code>.  Some subclasses of
 * <code>SeekableStream</code> guarantee the ability to seek backwards while
 * others may not offer this feature in the interest of providing greater
 * efficiency for those users who do not require it.
 *
 * <p> The <code>DataInput</code> interface is supported as well.  This included
 * the <code>skipBytes()</code> and <code>readFully()</code> methods and a
 * variety of <code>read</code> methods for various data types.
 *
 * <p> A number of concrete subclasses of <code>SeekableStream</code> are
 * supplied in the <code>com.sun.media.jai.codec</code> package.
 *
 * <p> Three classes are provided for the purpose of adapting a standard
 * <code>InputStream</code> to the <code>SeekableStream</code> interface.
 * <code>ForwardSeekableStream</code> does not allows seeking backwards, but is
 * inexpensive to use.  <code>FileCacheSeekableStream</code> maintains a copy of
 * all of the data read from the input in a temporary file; this file will be
 * discarded automatically when the <code>FileSeekableStream</code> is
 * finalized, or when the JVM exits normally.
 * <code>FileCacheSeekableStream</code> is intended to be reasonably efficient
 * apart from the unavoidable use of disk space.  In circumstances where the
 * creation of a temporary file is not possible,
 * <code>MemoryCacheSeekableStream</code> may be used.
 * <code>MemoryCacheSeekableStream</code> creates a potentially large in-memory
 * buffer to store the stream data and so should be avoided when possible.
 *
 * <p> The <code>FileSeekableStream</code> class wraps a <code>File</code> or
 * <code>RandomAccessFile</code>. It forwards requests to the real underlying
 * file.  It performs a limited amount of caching in order to avoid excessive
 * I/O costs.
 *
 * <p> The <code>SegmentedSeekableStream</code> class performs a different sort
 * of function.  It creates a <code>SeekableStream</code> from another
 * <code>SeekableStream</code> by selecting a series of portions or "segments".
 * Each segment starts at a specified location within the source
 * <code>SeekableStream</code> and extends for a specified number of bytes.  The
 * <code>StreamSegmentMapper</code> interface and <code>StreamSegment</code>
 * class may be used to compute the segment positions dynamically.
 *
 * <p> A convenience methods, <code>wrapInputStream</code> is provided to
 * construct a suitable <code>SeekableStream</code> instance whose data is
 * supplied by a given <code>InputStream</code>.  The caller, by means of the
 * <code>canSeekBackwards</code> parameter, determines whether support for
 * seeking backwards is required.
 *
