/**
 * This interface provides a way to catch errors and warnings from a
 * Transcoder.
 *
 * If an application needs to implement customized error handling, it
 * must implement this interface and then register an instance with
 * the Transcoder using the transcoder's setErrorHandler method. The
 * transcoder will then report all errors and warnings through this
 * interface.
 *
 * A transcoder shall use this interface instead of throwing an
 * exception: it is up to the application whether to throw an
 * exception for different types of errors and warnings. Note,
 * however, that there is no requirement that the transcoder continue
 * to provide useful information after a call to fatalError (in other
 * words, a transcoder class could catch an exception and report a
 * fatalError).
